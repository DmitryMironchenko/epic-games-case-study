# Getting started

To launch the app in dev mode run `yarn && yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:8080`.

# What's included

Included in this repo are a SQLite database file and a basic web server. You can use the UI to visually browse the data, as well as see some
example visualizations.

# Your challenge

Your task is to enhance the users' or developers' experience with this project. This can be done by adding a new feature, improving the codebase,
or any other tasks you think would improve the test project.

Some ideas to consider would be:

- Creating a UI for the users' raw SQL query history. This can be done either purely on the frontend side or by adding new API endpoints to support permanent storage of query logs in SQLite.
- Improving the mobile UI.
- Adding a new visualization of data such as kills by weapon type, etc..

We encourage you to spend no more than 6 hours on this task. You will be evaluated based on the quality of the code
and the creativity of the solutions. You are free to use any additional libraries that you feel are useful for accomplishing this task.
Use git as would you use in regular collaborative project. You will need to initialize project with `git init`, make initial commit and do all the changes in a feature branch.

# Returning solution

Please post a zip file containing your changes to `webrecruiting.easy.ac/solutions` via HTTP. Before zipping, please delete `node_modules/` folder.
The zip file should be named `yourfirstname.yourlastname.solutions.zip`. Include a markdown or text file explaining what you did and how you would improve the codebase.
Or you can leave your comments right in the codebase, but please make sure you mark them with `// IMPROVEMENT` tag.
